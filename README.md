# Valence UI

Valence UI is an opinionated design system and React component library designed by Isaac Shea. It is currently in use at [https://threaditor.net/](https://threaditor.net/), and is designed to be completely usable across all platforms.

### Motivation

&#x20;This library exists to combat shortcomings I (Isaac Shea) had found with other libraries. I had previously been using Mantine for my projects, however found I was re-constructing several core components _on top_ of Mantine, thus eventually decided to start from the bottom with my own design system.

Valence is updated alongside any current projects I work on, and thus closely follows my own personal design sense quite closely. I attempt to build in as much customizability as possible, however sometimes I am too lazy to add granular control.&#x20;
