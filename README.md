# Valence documentation
Welcome to the documentation for Valence! Valence is an opinionated React component library [I (Isaac Shea)](https://isaacshea.com/) designed with the primary intention of using it in my web development projects. It is heavily inspired by [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) and features a very similar development workflow. **Currently, Valence is in very early stages of its development**, thus it is not recommended for production use for anybody else. I have however decided to make it open source as I feel something like this benefits greatly from the opinions of multiple individuals.

## Getting started
(Coming soon). Currently, the package is not yet available on NPM, and cannot be easily setup. Once [v1.0](https://github.com/orgs/valence-dev/projects/1) has released, this section will be updated with setup instructions and best practices.

## The essentials
- [Theming](core/valence-provider.md)
- [Components](components/components.md)
- [Hooks](hooks/hooks.md)
- [Breakpoints](core/breakpoints.md)
- [Polymorphism](core/polymorphism.md)
