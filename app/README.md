# Valence App
> **Compatibility note:** `valence-ui-app` is incompatible with the `valence-ui-web` library. This is because many components in this division are also in the Web division, but are implemented and will appear vastly differently. One such example of this is the `<Nav>` component.

The Valence App division library contains a collection of components designed specifically for webapps. It entirely relies on the `valence-ui-core` and `valence-ui-utils` libraries. For an example of a site constructed using the Valence App library, see [Avant by Isaac Shea](https://avant.isaacshea.com/dashboard).
