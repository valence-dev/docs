# 2.7.0

* Added two new fill variants, `outlined` and `paper`. All components that accept the `variant` prop should now include support for these variants.
* Added the `getBorderHex()` method to the `useColors` hook, which is used to calculate ideal border colors for components using their color and variant. Effectively the same as the `getBgHex()` and `getFgHex()` methods also from the `useColors` hook.
