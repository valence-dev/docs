# 2.6.0

### Core

* Added `preferredColorScheme` to the [App Container](../valence-app/the-appcontainer.md), allowing apps to specify which color scheme they wish to use (or to just follow the system theme, as has been default)
* Reworked the [`UseColorScheme`](../valence-core/hooks/usecolorscheme.md) hook to incorporate these changes. This involved removing the `toggle`, `setDark` and `setLight` methods, as they were non-functional anyway.
* Added `brighterWhite` and `darkerBlack` to the [list of default colors](../core-concepts/color/list-of-colors.md). These are used in new Threaditor components, and will eventually be used in this library.
* Added `excludeColors` prop to the [Color Picker](../valence-core/components/inputs/color-picker.md). The Color Picker will now exclude `permaBlack`, `permaWhite` and `white` theme colors by default.
