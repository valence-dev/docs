# 2.0.0

Valence 2 (version 2.0.0) is the first major refresh of Valence, and includes a number of sweeping and breaking changes to the codebase.

* [Responsive props](../core-concepts/responsiveness.md) have replaced the Reactive props schema.
  * All components now support Responsiveness; this is no longer limited to select props.
* Restructured the [ValenceProvider](../valence-core/fundamentals/the-valenceprovider.md).
  * Added more breakpoints.
  * Moved `theme.defaultSize`, `theme.defaultRadius`, etc. to a custom `defaults` object.
* \[APP] The[ App Container](../valence-core/components/layout/the-appcontainer.md) has been rebuilt, improving general code quality and providing compatibility with a better [Sidebar](broken-reference).
* The [color system](../core-concepts/color/) has been rebuilt, and is now best accessed via the [useColors](../valence-core/hooks/usecolors.md) hook.
* Added the [Flex Center](../valence-core/components/layout/flex/flex-center.md) component.
* Added the [Dropdown Container](../valence-core/components/inputs/dropdown-container.md).
  * Rebuilt the [Pill Selector](../valence-core/components/inputs/pill-selector.md) & removed the Pill Input.
  * Rebuilt the [Select Input](../valence-core/components/inputs/select-input.md) using the new Dropdown Container.
* Added an automatic CSS override element that should remove the need for a `global.css` file to override basic page styles.
  * Added CSS to remove blue highlighting on clickable elements on mobile.
* Released new documentation here!
