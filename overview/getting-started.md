# üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting started

Valence is designed to be usable across  web-apps and native applications (via something like Capacitor.JS). Its functionality can also be expanded using Plugin packages, which provide novel features that may not be necessary for every developer.

## About the Core packages

```bash
npm install @valence-ui/core @valence-ui/utils
```

Valence's two core packages, `core` and `utils`, are required for all projects that use Valence. `utils` includes basic type declarations and low-level utilities, and `core` contains components, hooks, and the "meat" of the system.

**Updated in Valence 3**

Discipline packages have now been retired. This means that all components previously kept within the `app` package have been consolidated into the `core` package.
{% endhint %}

## About the Plugin packages

Plugin packages are completely optional packages that provide specific and sometimes niche utilities and components.
